My various configuration files for Linux, multi-OS apps, and to a lesser extent,
Windows.

Includes (but not limited to):

* bash
* tmux
* vi
* XFCE Terminal


## Purpose

I wanted a way to track changes and simplify bootstrapping new boxes.  Github
and a setup script allow me to accomplish this making home feel like home.  This
is a work in progress, specially the bootstrap method.

## Installation

This repo will get you the various configuration files, which, while marvelous
on their own, do very little for the things they're intending to configure.
They are, however, intended to be paired with [my ansible deployment
automation](https://git.theclonchs.com/chris/ansible-desktop-playbooks).

## Inspiration

I've borrowed/learned a thing or two from the following folks:

* [cowboy/dotfiles](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles)
* [rtomayko/dotfiles](https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles)
* [hamvocke/dotfiles](https://github.com/hamvocke/dotfiles)
